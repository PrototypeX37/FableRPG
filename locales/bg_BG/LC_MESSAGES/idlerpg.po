"**Game modes:** `Classic` (default), `Imbalanced`, `Huntergame`, "

"`Classic`: Play the classic werewolf game. (default)\n"
"`Imbalanced`: Some roles that are only available in larger games have "
"chances to join even in smaller games. (The size of the game being referred "
"here is about the number of players, i.e. 5-player game is small)\n"
"`Huntergame`: Only Hunters and Werewolves are available.\n"
"`Villagergame`: No special roles, only Villagers and Werewolves are "
"available.\n"
"`Valentines`: There are multiple lovers or couples randomly chosen at the "
"start of the game. A chain of lovers might exist upon the Amor's arrows. If "
"the remaining players are in a single chain of lovers, they all win.\n"
"`IdleRPG`: (based on Imbalanced mode) New roles are available: Paragon, "
"Raider, Ritualist, Lawyer, Troublemaker, War Veteran, Wolf Shaman, Wolf "
"Necromancer, Superspreader."
