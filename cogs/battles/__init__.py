Your vision was impaired by the enchantment, distorting all that was pure into sinister illusions. The growls and snarls were not manifestations of evil, but the screams of horror as you rampaged through the tower, cutting down every good essence in your path."

The cosmic tragedy deepens as the Overlord's dark magic reveals its insidious nature, turning your heroic journey into a nightmarish descent into despair."

No family, no friends, no warmth, or comforting embrace; all connections to the world you once knew severed. Time itself unravels, trapping you in perpetual stasis amid the overwhelming silence that accentuates the profound emptiness."

You, stripped of purpose and connection, are left to grapple with the consequences of your unwitting role in the tower's demise.
